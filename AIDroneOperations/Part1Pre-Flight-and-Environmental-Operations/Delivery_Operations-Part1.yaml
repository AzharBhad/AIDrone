#Provide more specific details about all of these additional components or explore other aspects of the system and other operations such as Pre-Flight Operations,
#Environmental & Operational Conditions (ODD), Operational Workflow, System Architecture (ODD-compliant), Safety & Emergency Procedures, Monitoring & Compliance,
#Advanced Sensor Integration & Data Fusion, Detailed Flight Phase Requirements, Advanced Safety Systems, Delivery Zone Requirements,
#System Integration & Monitoring and generate ASAM OpenODD yaml file for all the operations. Also generate mermaid file for all operations

#Copilot said: I'll help break this down into detailed
#I'll help break this down into detailed components and generate comprehensive YAML and Mermaid files for the AI Autonomous Drone Delivery System. Due to the extensive content, I'll split this into multiple focused sections.
